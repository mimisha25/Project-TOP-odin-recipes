    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add onion, garlic, basil (if using), oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent and light golden brown, about 7 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Increase heat to medium-high. Add beef and break up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if needed, until beef begins to brown, about 8 minutes; season with 1 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, crush tomatoes and their juices with your hands until small pieces form. Add tomatoes and Parmesan rind to saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces by about one-quarter and raw tomato flavor has cooked out, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat; discard Parmesan rind.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Add butter and remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1 teaspoon salt; toss to combine until sauce is glossy and butter is melted.</p>
